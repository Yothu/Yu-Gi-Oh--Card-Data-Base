### Usage
Before you begin testing and experimenting, remember to use the Terminal to create a branch by running:
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>

Alternatively, if you use GitFlow, you can run the following command to create a new branch:
```
git flow feature start <branch-name>
```

After that you should be ready to go.

### Run tests
Before pushing changes to your branch, I would recommend opening this file:

```
/.github/workflows/linters.yml
```

install and run webhint, stylelint, and eslint

These linters will help you fit your code to this repo's syntax standard.

### Deployment
Once you're done with your changes, remember to ```git pull``` before doing ```git push``` this will update 
your local copy of the project if someone else made changes to the repo while you worked on your part.
